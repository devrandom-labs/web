title: "Introducing Nova: Your Verifiable Security Swarm"
subtitle: "Nova: Autonomous, Decentralized, and Verifiable Security"
steps:
  - title: "Deploy"
    description: "Lightweight AI agents are deployed across your digital infrastructure (cloud instances, networks, endpoints)."
  - title: "Verify & Collaborate"
    description: "Each agent has a unique Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). They form a trusted, decentralized network, continuously verifying each other and collaborating to hunt for anomalies."
  - title: "Neutralize & Report"
    description: "When a threat is detected and confirmed by the swarm, it is autonomously neutralized. Every action is recorded on an immutable ledger, providing a fully verifiable audit trail."
features:
  - title: "Agent Swarm Intelligence"
    description: "Proactive, 24/7 threat hunting that learns and adapts."
    benefit: "Drastically reduce response times from hours to seconds."
  - title: "SSI-Based Trust"
    description: "Each agent's identity and communication is cryptographically secured."
    benefit: "Eliminates the risk of rogue AI agents and ensures a tamper-proof chain of command."
  - title: "Decentralized Resilience"
    description: "No single point of failure. The swarm continues to operate even if parts of your network are compromised."
    benefit: "Unprecedented resilience against sophisticated attacks."
